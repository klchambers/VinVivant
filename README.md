# VinVivant

VinVivant is a blog about natural wine featuring natural wine reviews, with the option for the user to sign up to a newsletter to receive blog posts via email, and a contact form to enter their contact details and send a message.

It is primarily targeted at those with an interest in wine and natural winemaking, but the informative nature of the site will make it ideal for those without prior knowledge to learn more, with the potential to add blog posts about different, grape varietals, winemaking regions, terminology, and styles.
